## ‚úÇÔ∏è Line-Clamp

Use `line-clamp-{rows}` to specify how many lines of text should be visible before truncating.

### Usage

```jsx
<p class="line-clamp-2 md:line-clamp-4">
    I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.
    In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.
    That‚Äôs what I do: I drink and I know things.
</p>
```

Use `line-clamp-none` to remove any line-clamping.
```jsx
<p class="line-clamp-4 lg:line-clamp-none">
    I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.
    In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.
    That‚Äôs what I do: I drink and I know things.
</p>
```
